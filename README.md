## Introduction

- A novice attempt in trying to build a basic React application with basic React knowledge that fetches tour data from an external URL and displays it on the screen. Users can browse through different tours, remove tours they are not interested in, and when the list is empty users can re-fetch the tours to restore the initial list.

- Tours: https://react-vite-tours.netlify.app

#### Setup

- npm install
- npm run dev
